# Advanced_Regression


Identified is there are any missing values.
1> If missing percentage is more then 80% removeed those columns
2> If missing percentage is less then, replace using mean/ median/ mode. in my work I have used Mean for Interger, and Mode for Str type

Visualized heat map to check multi collinarity

Checked for correlation of each independent variable with dependent variable

Removed multicollinear columns

Build model with column which are highly correlated with taget column

Normalized the data

Split 70: 30 data for train and test

Build lasso and ridge regression model with parametring set of values using grid search
